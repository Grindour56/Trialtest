# Trialtest
##Purpose
This is to familiarise with git , here we will write 3 python functions and merge them.As a single programs we will write them in two ways
1.As separate programs 
2.As a single file to familiarise with merge conflicts
## Tech Stack

- Language: Python (or whatever you're using)
- Tools: Git, GitHub

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git

2. Enter the directory:
   cd project-name

3. Run the project:
   python main.py

## Collaboration Rules

- Create a new branch for each feature
- Open a Pull Request
- No direct pushes to main
- Resolve conflicts before merging
